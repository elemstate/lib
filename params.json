{"name":"elemstate-lib","tagline":"","body":"elemstate-lib is a javascript library that uses a simple state machine model to set CSS classes on HTML elements.\r\n\r\nThe ESMCssRoot attribute is used to apply elemstate functionality to an element, as follows:\r\n\r\n  <code>&lt;div esmCssRoot='hello'&gt;hello, i'm the hello tool&lt;/div&gt;</code>\r\n\r\nCSS is declared for the applicable states for each root name (root_state), as follows:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n  .hello {..}<br/>\r\n  .hello_focused {..}<br/>\r\n  .hello_toggled {..}<br/>\r\n  .hello_waiting {..}<br/>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nWhen a state is added or removed on an element (during an event or with a call to ESM.setState), the CSS class is changed to reflect the new combination.\r\n\r\nAssuming all the above states are active on the hello element, statetools would set:\r\n\r\n  <code>class = 'hello hello_focused hello_toggled hello_waiting'</code>\r\n\r\nelemstate.js (in the gh_pages branch) contains more detailed doc.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://elemstate.github.io/lib/elemstate/statetools_helloworld.html\">Demo page</a>\r\n\r\nAn application that uses elemstate-lib:\r\n<a href=\"http://thoughtwallet.github.io/wallet\">ThoughtWallet</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
